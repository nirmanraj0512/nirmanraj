           As a developer, I specialize in Full-Stack Web Development with deep expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I am highly proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript , which I use to build dynamic and scalable applications with modern technologies like React.js, Next.js, and Node.js. My technical skills also extend to the .NET Framework and Web3.js.




For efficient development, I leverage tools like Redux for state management , Vite for fast builds , and Tailwind CSS for responsive design. This practical experience is supported by a solid foundation in system design, networking , and data structures , along with proficiency in other languages such as C++ and Advance SQL.
